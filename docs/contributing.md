You start developping from the `dev` branch using your custom branch c.f.: `feat`. You split your project to several Merge Requests (MR) with the smallest functionality possible.
Once the code is ready and approved you merge into `dev` branch. At this point some of the automatic CI/CD actions will take place (...).
Realeses are going to be done from the `main` branch so we will frequentle merge the `dev` branch into the `main` branch. The release process is semi-automatic and you need to start it manually). This means that the simple `main` merge won't do anything excep preparing code for the release. We use the semantic release to automatically generate and propagate the project changelogs (tag/close issues, tag merge requests, send Slack notifications etc).

When you start developping a new feature within Parrot, you can follow the typical development pattern:

## ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Contribution Cycle Guidelines

- [x] Make sure you have installed the pre-commit hook locally

  ??? installation-guide
  Before using pre-commit hook you need to install it in your python environment.

        ```bash
        conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
        ```

        go to the root folder of this repository, activate your venv and use the following command:

        ```bash
        pre-commit install
        ```

- [x] Create a new branch from DEV to package your code

  ??? Branch-naming-convention
  The bets way to organize your local git history would be to use the following branch naming convention:

        ```{ACRONYM}/{LABEL (CI|FEAT|TEST|DOCS ...)}/{message}```

        i.e.: ```CEREBRO/DOCS/doc_adding_contribution_explanation```

- [x] Use standarized commit message:

  `{LABEL}(ACRONYM): {message}`

  This is very important for the automatic releases (semantic release) and to have clean history on the master branch.

  ??? Labels-types

- [x] Create your first Merge Request (MR) as soon as possible.

  > Merge requests will be responsible for semantic-release storytelling and so use them wisely! The changelog report generated automatically will be based on your commits merged into main branch and should cover all the thins you did for the project, as an example:

- [x] Separate your merge requests based on LABEL or functionality if you are working on `feat` label

  > This about what part of feature you are working on, (messages) i.e.:

        - `initializaing base pre-processing code`
        - `init repo structure`
        - `adding pre-processing unit-tests`

- [x] Once the code is ready create a Merge Request (MR) into the DEV branch with a proper naming convention

  > The name of your MR should follow the same exact convention as your commits (we have a dedicated check for this in the CI):

        `{LABEL}(ACRONYM): {message}`

  Your MR creation should be communicated using dedicated Slack Channel

- [x] Use small Merge Requests but do them more ofthen < 400 ligns for quicker and simple review and not the whole project !

- [x] Ask for a Code Review !

- [x] Once your MR is approved, solve all your unresolved conversation and pass all the CI check before you can merge it.

- [x] All the Tests for your code should pass -> REMEMBER NO TESTS = NO MERGE üö®

- [x] Remember to squash your commits (or squash & merge) during the merge !

  !!! warning
  Always check if the last commit (the once that is going to be used for the merge) follows the convention and describes the work you did in the correct way.
